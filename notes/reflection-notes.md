# Notebook Building - Reflection

## Reflection

 *Discuss nature of collaboration --> who did what and why and was this equitable*
- chantal did programming
  - chantal did the programming and explained to me
  - chantal edited
- sara did notes
  - concepts done by me or together
  - sara had idea and chantal had tech knowledge
  - sara wrote the notes
- equitable as chantal was comfortable with tech and we played to our strengths and worked well as a team :)


*Managing conflict*
- we had none


 *Organization (this!)*
- met over the course of 2 weeks to program and discuss conceptive notebook while building the Notebook
  - used [github](https://github.com/ChantalMB/HIST4916-GLAM-Notebook/projects) and the [kanban](https://github.com/ChantalMB/HIST4916-GLAM-Notebook/projects/1) board to stay on top of eachother's work
-


 *What lessons your collaboration might imply for GLAM organizations*
- arts and science can work together lol
  - chantal would not have thought of user input point where you can find new things for yourself and new interests
  - we each bring something to the table
- how museums interact with the digital and how it can be interesting
  - chantal=how she would go into a museum
  - sara=how i would bring someone into a Museum


 *Walk user through notebook*
- answer the whys of the notebook
  - draw on specific things and state the section and importance


 *Ways notebook could be extended --> suggest questions a user might want to pose*
- provide more context to the artifacts/related artifacts
  - good and bad
- it could be cool if we could have a path of how they were acquired (hold stuff we trust reading)
- later on if this was legit/real we could look at who is accessing it and the stats and stuff
  - time spent and correlation to the museum (is air and space more popular than farm?)
- issues with information about the artifact
  - ingenium practicum experience me
- think about the stuff we took away because there was no image, good or bad
- think about this as just a museum
  - post digital visitor
- summarize why questions from walkthrough
  - overall


 *Why notebook might matter*
- showcase the collection
- pose questions of what belongs in the collection and why
  - whose canada does it reflect?
- can lead to new information/reflections when seeing the artifact out of context
    - instead of seeing them in the context of war, see them as things/in context of themselves
- stuff we trust reading and accessibility
  - good, but this is still limited to people with computers (128 and elitism)
- is it bad that we take some artifacts out of context?
- makes people see things they might not see or think of researching
- footnotes here
  - matters becasue we talked about this in class
- discussed these in class, this is what lead us to the notebook topic
- INGENIUM EXPEREINCE FOR ME
- I LIKE MUSEUMS

 By providing guidance on the ‘so what’ question, you will engage with the literature or issues and provide context for non-dh-minded folk should take this work seriously.

### SOURCES CONSULTED

**Collections: How We Hold the Stuff We Hold in Trust**

125
"This paradigm asserts that once the Museum possesses something, they alone own it, and they hold onto it tightly"

" We question the legacies of institutions whose missions were to preserve, categorize, and document human achievement and history at a time when large portions of our populations weren't considered human at all"
- something about how our thing can talk about what is considered technology and what is not, or like why are there more Western tech vs other

""

 **the whole story**
But storytelling is a potent way for museums to present inclusive and nuanced history, to make big ideas less overwhelming and abstract, and to create frames of experience that encourage deep and satisfying engagement for visitors and online users. Storytelling is an additional method of interpretation to the traditional mode of direct information delivery—the stark presentation of “the facts.”
- kind of like  choose your own adventure/story with our random artifacts, audience sees random artifacts in random order and can see how they connect or make their own connections

 **why do we collect**
- In conclusion, if archives and museums continue to collect and preserve First Nations cultural heritage, they must do so based on the interests of First Nations communities and must be willing to change their perceptions around preservation, to be not just in a Western way and reform their collecting and preserving practices.
  - thinking about what is technology and who determines what is new technology vs Hold

 **post digital visitor**
- It was suggested that certain characteristics of the Internet had the potential to change how people learn and therefore their expectations of museum learning experiences.
  - how our part of the internet could shape the museum learning experience

 **problems with data on github**
- commit log point at the bottom and chantal and william's points about it

 **Preservation Challenges in the Digital Age**
- 2.1 data volumes
  - how did we decide what to include (only things with images)
  - how did they decide what to include in the digitalization thing^
- 2.2 archivability^
